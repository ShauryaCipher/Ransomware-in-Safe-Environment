# Ransomware Prevention Strategies

This document provides information on how to prevent ransomware attacks. These best practices are for educational purposes to help understand how to protect systems against real threats.

## Technical Preventive Measures

### 1. Backup Strategy
- Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule: 3 copies of data, on 2 different media types, with 1 copy offsite
- Ensure backups are stored offline or on isolated systems not accessible from the network
- Regularly test backup restoration to verify integrity
- Use write-once media or backup systems that prevent unauthorized modification

### 2. System Security
- Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest security patches
- Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized programs from executing
- Use least privilege principles - limit user permissions to only what's necessary
- Disable unnecessary services, especially remote access services when not needed
- Use strong firewalls and network segmentation to limit lateral movement

### 3. Email Security
- Implement robust email filtering to detect phishing and malicious attachments
- Scan all email attachments and links before allowing user access
- Block high-risk attachment types (.exe, .vbs, .js, etc.)
- Use email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) to reduce spoofing

### 4. Endpoint Protection
- Deploy modern endpoint protection with behavioral analysis capabilities
- Enable reputation services to block known malicious sites and files
- Use application control to prevent unauthorized script execution
- Implement browser isolation for high-risk browsing

### 5. Network Security
- Segment networks to limit lateral movement if one system is compromised
- Implement DNS filtering to block access to known malicious domains
- Use intrusion detection/prevention systems to identify suspicious activity
- Monitor network traffic for anomalous behavior

## Administrative Controls

### 1. User Training
- Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees
- Train staff to recognize phishing emails and social engineering tactics
- Create clear procedures for reporting suspicious activities
- Perform simulated phishing tests to measure awareness

### 2. Incident Response Planning
- Develop a comprehensive incident response plan specifically for ransomware
- Define roles and responsibilities during a ransomware incident
- Establish communication channels that will work even if systems are encrypted
- Practice the plan through tabletop exercises and simulations

### 3. Access Management
- Implement strong password policies (complexity, regular changes, MFA)
- Use multi-factor authentication for all remote access and critical systems
- Regularly audit user accounts and remove unnecessary access rights
- Implement time-based access controls for administrative functions

## Early Detection Mechanisms

### 1. Monitoring
- Monitor file systems for unexpected encryption activities
- Look for high numbers of file modifications in short time periods
- Deploy honeypot files that trigger alerts when accessed
- Monitor for unusual access patterns to file servers

### 2. Behavior Analytics
- Implement user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)
- Set baselines for normal system behaviors and alert on deviations
- Monitor for unusual process ancestry (e.g., Office applications spawning PowerShell)
- Track unusual login attempts or privilege escalation

## Recovery Planning

### 1. Isolation Procedures
- Develop procedures to quickly isolate infected systems
- Create network segregation capabilities that can be rapidly deployed
- Implement automated system isolation based on suspicious behavior
- Train staff on when and how to disconnect systems from the network

### 2. Restoration Process
- Document detailed restoration procedures from backups
- Maintain offline copies of restoration tools and procedures
- Establish priorities for system restoration based on business needs
- Test restoration procedures regularly

## Conclusion

No single security measure can guarantee protection against ransomware. A defense-in-depth approach combining technical controls, user awareness, and operational procedures provides the best protection against these evolving threats.
